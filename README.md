# Diabetes Risk Prediction Model

This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, and medical history. The objective was to explore how classification models can support early risk estimation and identify the most influential health factors associated with diabetes.

The project workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, and training multiple classification models including logistic regression and linear-based approaches. Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics to assess predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Results show that physiological indicators such as glucose and BMI are strong predictors of diabetes risk. This demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to healthcare data to support preventative awareness and data-driven health insights.
